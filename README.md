# Ultralearning Software and Machine Learning

This is the start of my Ultralearning project. Taking inspiration from the author of Ultra Learning, Scott Young and the author of Deep Work, Cal Newport. I am planning to devote the next several months of my life immersing myself into becoming really good at programming, machine learning and building products with both. 

I do have a full-time job as an energy engineer, helping setup Solar plants, and working on other energy related projects that my company pursues. However, I do have some background in Machine learning and programming through my Master's degree in Scientific Computing at the University of Pennsylvania, which I completed in April 2024. However, I do find several gaps in my software knowledge, and I want to go from a person who has done a few coding classes well, to a deep understanding of software, machine learning and applying it to real world problems including those in my work, and pushing myself to see how far a solo software programmer can go in the age of AI tools like chatGPT, cursor etc. 

I am going to build myself a curriculum using the course work available from the University of Pennsylvania. I will also supplement this with other courses available on Youtube, EDX, MIT etc. I will be using the free version of the code editor cursor, as coding with AI appears to be the way forward, and that is a skill that I want to develop. 

Each folder will be named after certain broad topics, such as programming for beginners, machine learning etc and contain the courses I plan to do to acquire those skills.
