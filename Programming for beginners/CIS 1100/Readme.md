Why am I doing the material of this course? 

I want to become really proficient in the writing code in Python, and want to go over the beginner level class to fill in any gaps in my understanding of Programming. 

I am defining completion of this class as completing all the homework assignments, projects and quizzes posted as a part of this version of CIS 1100 covering Python linked below: For this class, I will not use an AI code assistant for the programming homeworks. And all exams will be closed book, and timed as done in the class.

This course is made up of check-in assigments, programming projects, midterm exams, final exam.
