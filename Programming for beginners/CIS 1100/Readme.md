**Why am I doing the material of this course? **

I want to become really proficient in the writing code in Python, and want to go over the beginner level class to fill in any gaps in my understanding of Programming. 

**Completion: **

I am defining completion of this class as completing all the homework assignments, projects, quizzes and exams posted as a part of this version of CIS 1100 covering Python linked below: For this class, I will not use an AI code assistant for the programming homeworks. And all exams will be closed book, and timed as done in the class.
